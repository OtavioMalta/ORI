Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
And we'll be alright
Just you and I
Just you and I (just you and I)
Sharing our love together
And I know in time (and I know in time)
We'll build the dreams we treasure
And we'll be alright
Just you and I
And I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made, ooh
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before
Just you and I (just you and I)
We care and trust each other
With you in my life (with you in my life)
There'll never be another
We'll be alright
Just you and I
And I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made, ooh
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before
We made it, you and I
