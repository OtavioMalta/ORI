Thinkin' back in time
When love was only in my mind
I realize, ain't no second chance
You've got to hold on to romance
Don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share
Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm, oh so glad, I found you
Need you ev'ry day
Gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you
Spendin' ev'ry dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together
Out in any kind of weather
Just because
There's a brand-new way
Of looking at your life
When you know that love
Is standing by your side
Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day
Gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you
The nights can be cold
There's a chill to ev'ry evenin'
When you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here
To keep you warm
(Oh, darling keep me warm)
Baby, come to me
(Come to me)
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
(My love)
And I'm oh so, glad I found you
(Oh, so glad I found you)
Need you ev'ry day
(Ev'ry day)
Gotta have your love around me
(Gotta have you)
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you
Come to me
(Let me put my arms around you)
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
(Hey, I need you ev'ry day, baby)
And I'm oh, so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day
Gotta have your love around me
(Gotta have you and I want you to stay)
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you
Come to me
(Come to me)
Let me put my arms around you
(Love me, love me, baby)
This was meant to be
And I'm, oh so glad, I found you
